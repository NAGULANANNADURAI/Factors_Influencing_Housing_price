# Factors_Influencing_Housing_price
1.0 Introduction
Real estate sector heavily relies on accurate and up-to-date data to make informed decisions about buying, selling and managing properties. However, working with real estate datasets can be challenging due to outdated, incomplete, and inaccurate information. This can result in inaccurate property valuations, missed investment opportunities, and inefficient business operations. To illustrate, consider the given dataset that aims to maximize the sale values of houses based on factors like area, bedrooms, parking, etc. In summary, the organization's objectives are to identify the factors that influence home pricing, create a linear model that connects house values to factors like square footage and number of bathrooms, and measure the model's accuracy in predicting house prices.
